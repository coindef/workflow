# DecisionWeave

DecisionWeave is an agentic AI consulting and decision-engineering system that turns complex organizational decisions into executable, auditable outcomes.

## Architecture

DecisionWeave uses an **artifact-first, contract-first** approach:

- **Artifact-First**: The system's primary output is a typed `DecisionArtifact` - a complete, evidence-backed, executable decision package.
- **Contract-First**: Every decision starts with a `DecisionContract` that defines the executable specification.
- **Simulation-First**: Before final approval, draft artifacts undergo parallel multi-agent stress testing.
